*[CPA]: Certified Public Accountant

## An art project

I have been fascinated by websites since the mid-nineties. Back then we had to code them by hand, and there was no such thing as  [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html). My first website was rudimentary by today's standards  As time has gone by, I have witnessed several advancements. (I remember sitting across the hall from the lab at [Turner Broadcasting](https://www.tbs.com/) when the technician figured how to push short videos to web browsers frame by frame.) Today web sites can do amazing things and I enjoy exploring the aesthetic side of things.

## A work in progress

In my current career, my second, I am a CPA, but I began designing software in my teens after seeing the movie *War Games*. Even now, I still spend my leisure time tinkering with software.

This blog is generated using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator. The fun part about Eleventy (for me) is that it is written in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), running on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and supporting [many template languages](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/). I enjoy having many tools at my disposal to use to make whatever improvements I decide on. This is the project that I tweak to get it just how I like it.

## A place to write

Over the years, I have occasionally had things on my mind that I wanted to express. This site is a place where I can express my thoughts. What resides here are my thoughts, and my opinions, and mine alone. Hopefully, what I have put here is valuable to you.
