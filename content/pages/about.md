*[CPA]: Certified Public Accountant
Welcome to my personal blog!  I'm {{ siteConfig.author.name }}, and I'm thrilled to have yoou here. I wear many wear manyu hats: I'm a former software engineer, a CPA, and a passionate gospel preacher.

I love spending time with my wife and have many hobbies. I am never bored.

## My Calling

The Bible says, "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness...,"[^1] and to that end, I enjoy studying the Bible. Learning about Jesus and sharing His teaching brings me grat joy. I find it incredibly rewarding to help others navigate their spiritual journeys and grow in faith. Preaching at a small church in Edisto Island, South Carolina has been a fulfilling endeavor that allows me to fulfill the calling of sharing God's Word with others[^2].
