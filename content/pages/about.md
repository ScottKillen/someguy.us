*[CPA]: Certified Public Accountant

## An art project

My fascination with websites began in the mid-nineties, a time when we had to code everything by hand and [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html) didn't exist. My first website was rudimentary by today’s standards, but it marked the beginning of an exciting journey. I recall sitting across the hall from the lab at [Turner Broadcasting](https://www.tbs.com/) when the technician figured out how to push short videos to web browsers frame by frame—a groundbreaking moment! Today, websites can achieve incredible things, and I relish exploring the aesthetic side of web design.

## A work in progress

In my current career, I am a CPA, but my roots are in software design, a passion ignited in my teens after watching the movie *War Games*. Despite my professional path, I still spend my leisure time tinkering with software, driven by a love for the craft.

This blog is generated using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator. The joy of Eleventy lies in its use of [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), running on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and supporting [many template languages](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/). I thrive on having a diverse set of tools at my disposal, continually tweaking this project to achieve my ideal vision.
