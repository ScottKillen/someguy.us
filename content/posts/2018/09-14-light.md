I sit beneath Your radiance,  
oblivious to life  
except where the shadows end.

You light my path,  
the sun dead by comparison.  
My feet find purchase.

I remember the darkness,  
life before You,  
the vestigial wisp of night.

I am warm.  
My soul fills itself  
with Your refulgent song.

Love, the abiding tree  
basks in Your glow,  
full of healing fruit that is ever ripe.

The moon dances with the sun  
circling in orbit,  
learning Your lessons.

I am enthralled by Your light,  
examining, searching,  
knowing it will quell every doubt.

You are my daydream,  
lighting my life,  
washing the shadows away.

*[John 1:9-13](https://www.esv.org/verses/John%201%3A9-13/)*
