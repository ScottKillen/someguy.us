Break me.

Put me on my knees,  
where I can find that life  
is not about me.

Break me.

Show me that life  
can suffer a bruising  
and get back up.

Break me.

Mold me into  
the sculpture I can be  
from the lump I am.

Break me.

Show me the beauty of friendship,  
hands grasping mine,  
pulling me up.

Break me.

Let me grow beyond  
the shell of myself,  
rising to heights unseen.
