Morning mist whispers  
waiting for dawn,  
gather together in earnest.

Birds sing sparsely,  
tuning instruments,  
awaiting Conductor’s cues.

Solemn trees bestir,  
rousing from slumber,  
uprooting forest dreams.

Flowers turn,  
seeking truth,  
searching for life renewed.

Apropos Sun emerges from shadow,  
ringing joy’s bell,  
new day begins brighter still.
