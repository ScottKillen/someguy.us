My rusting chains  
enslave me.  

i am beaten  
with the rigors  
of life.  

i am auctioned  
on the block.  

An ode to  
gold and silver  
is my dirge.  

No one pays  
the Price on  
my head.  

There is only  
one end-  
i am nothing  
except  
to be used  
and tossed away.  

The Son offers his shoulder.  

i dig a  
tomb in my  
burdens.  
Hope’s dark fuse  
lies cold  
and buried.  

Why have i  
turned from Him?  

The Master is not my master-but he pays the Price!  
His heart is pierced because he knows my sin-  
He sealed my ransom with sanguine scarlet.  

My head tucks in Shoulder’s hollow, spent from my struggle.  

Jesus, King of Kings, Lord of Lords, my true Master,  
paid my ransom and more, royal blood for a peasant’s life.  
Pure love, a king’s life for my own!  
All my stripes worn by Him.  

All to Him I owe.
