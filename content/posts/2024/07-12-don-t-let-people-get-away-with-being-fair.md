Be very wary of people who use the word fair. Fair is subjective, and everyone assigns it a different meaning. It is almost a certainty that the person using the word and the person hearing the word have defined it differently.

When leaders and politicians use the word 'fair', it is a cheat because it always generates a pleasant idea in the listener's mind without requiring any specific commitment on the speaker's part.

When you hear someone use the word fair, you should perceive the ambiguity and ask for details: "What EXACTLY do you mean when you say fair?"
